## Learn HTML

**When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?**
When you want to create a list of items in no particular order.

**How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?**
You can use CSS to get rid of any text decoration, such as the bullet points in an unordered list.

**When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?**
Unordered lists are used when the order of the items doesn't matter. Ordered lists are used for sequential information. So, if you are using sequential information, you should use an ordered list.

**Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?**
An ordered lsit can be numeric or alphabetic. You can use type attribute, which allows you to change the style of numbers in an ordered list. Another way you can do it is by using the start attritbute. This will allow you to start counting a list from a specified number.

## Learn CSS

**Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?**
If I were to describe the charatcers margin and padding in a story called "The Box Model," the margins would be the security guard outside for a building. It's job is to protect the space around the building (element's border). Then there is a padding, which is the security guard for the inside of the buidling. The padding protects the inside space of the building.

**List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.**
Content, padding, border, and margin.

## Learn JS

**What data types can you store inside of an Array?**
Array's can store numbers, strings, boolean values (true and false), characters, and objects.

**Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?**
I believe so because all those items in that container are people and their information. You can access the values stored by using bracket notation and supplying the item's index, in the same way that you accessed the letters in a string.

**List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.**

- x = f(). This is an assignment that
- x += f(). This is an addition assignment
- x -= f(). This is a subtraction assignment
- x *= f(). This is multiplicaiton assignment
- x /= f(). This is a division assignment and it

**Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.**
> // evaluate this
 (a + c) + b;

The results of this expression would be that a + c first, and then + b, finding its value.

**Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.**
A real world example would be passwords. Passwords are >if, then> logic statements so if a user enters the correct
password, they then can access the program.

**Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.**
When you want to use the same code, you can use a loop so you don't have to rewrite the code however many times.
