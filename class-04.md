## Learn HTML

**To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?**
An < a >, anchor element

**The href attribute contains what information?**
The href specifies the URL of the external resource, like a style sheet.

**What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?**
Keep the link text short and simple. Don't use URLs for link text either, and don't use the word link as part of the link text.

## CSS layout

**What is meant by “normal flow”?**
Normal flow is the way that block and inline elements are displayed on a page before any changes are made to their layout.

**What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?**
By default, block-level elements are laid out in the block flow direction. So, each element will appear on a new line below the last one, with each one separated by whatever margin that's been specified. Inline elements don't appear on new lines so they all sit on the same line along with any wrapped text content as long as there is space for them inside the width of the parent block-level element. If there isn't space, then the overflowing content will move down to a new line.

**___ positioning is the default for every html element.**
Static positioning

**Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.**
When using absolute positioning, you can create isolated UI features that don't interfere with the layout of other elements on the page. For example, popup information boxes, control menus, rollover panels, UI features that can be dragged and dropped anywhere on the page.

**What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?**
Absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the initial containing block if there isn't one), while fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport.

## Learn JS

**Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.**
Declared functions are not executed immediately. They are saved for later to then be executed when they are invoked (called upon).

**What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?**
The values that are declared within a function when the function is called upon are known as an argument. The variables that are defined when the function is declared are parameters.

## Miscellaneous

**Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.**
One benefit to pair programming is Learning from fellow students. This could help me on my coding journey by seeing and understanding the other ways that people may code, and some ways may be more helpful for me too.
Another benefit is social skills. I think by learning to work with others and their code, it can help with future collaborations in the work place and just undetanding that there's many different approaches within programming.
