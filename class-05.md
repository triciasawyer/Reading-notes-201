## HTML Media

**What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?**
Alt attributes enable screen readers to read the information about on-page images. This benefits people with complete lack of sight, visually impaired, and just those who are unable to view the images on the page.

**How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?**
Add alt text, which will make the images more accessible to those who have disabilities.

**Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.**
A figure element would be useful to use when you want to place things in a container such as an aside or figure, but you should use figure if the content is essential, but it's exact position on the page is important.

**Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.**
Gif images are not resolution independent which makes them look pixelated when scaled up or viewed on higher resolutions. Svg images are scalable and resolution-independent, allowing them to look clear on any screen resolution.

**What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?**
PNG or WebP because they are defaults for almost all screen capture tools. Therefore, they will appear good quality.
