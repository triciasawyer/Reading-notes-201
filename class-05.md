## HTML Media

**What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?**
Alt attributes enable screen readers to read the information about on-page images. This benefits people with complete lack of sight, visually impaired, and just those who are unable to view the images on the page.

**How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?**
Add alt text, which will make the images more accessible to those who have disabilities.

**Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.**
A figure element would be useful to use when you want to place things in a container such as an aside or figure, but you should use figure if the content is essential, but it's exact position on the page is important.

**Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.**
Gif images are not resolution independent which makes them look pixelated when scaled up or viewed on higher resolutions. Svg images are scalable and resolution-independent, allowing them to look clear on any screen resolution.

**What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?**
PNG or WebP because they are defaults for almost all screen capture tools. Therefore, they will appear good quality.

**Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.**
Foregorund controls what color your brush or pencil will be, while the background color erases any added color and replaces it with the background color.

**Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?**
I would first add a background color to the body of his page, creating lots of color behind the blog page. I would then look at my friends blog page and see where I can add a different color in the background on certain paragraphs or headings, so those parts stick out. I would also maybe change some text color and add different weights such as bold so the page doesn't just blend all together.

**What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?**
You should consider the user and how well they could see. So don't choose a crazy font that only certain peoope can read.

**What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?**
Font size changes the size of the font. Font weight will change the value placed on your font, such as bold or light text. Font style is used to specifiy italic text. So you can change how the text looks such as italic or just normal.

**Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element.**
You can do that by adding padding or margins to the h1 element.
