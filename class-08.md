## Learn CSS - Flexbox

**Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.**
Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout model that was designed to provide greater control over alignment and space distribution between items within a container. Being one-dimensional, it only deals with layout in a single direction - columns or rows - at a time. This works well for smaller layouts, such as components

**Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.**
The cross axis runs perpendicular to the main axis, therefore if your flex-direction (main axis) is set to row or row-reverse the cross axis runs down the columns. If your main axis is column or column-reverse then the cross axis runs along the rows

**How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?**
Older browsers will not support. Different containership concepts need to learn.
