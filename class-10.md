## Troubleshooting JavaScript

**Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.**
Syntax errors occur when a program does not conform to the grammar of a programming language, and the compiler cannot compile the source file. Logic errors occur when a program does not do what the programmer expects it to do.

**List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.**
I have had an error on a parentElement, and it was because I hadn't named that parent element so it didn't recognize what I meant by storing something within that parent element.

Another error I had a lot was when I defined something in javascript, but it wasn't used it. It looked scary at first because in my head, I was like oh no is it wrong, but it will say that until you use that element that you already defined.

**How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?**
By learning about the errors from personal experience, as well as reading about it and what the errors are and mean, it will help me for the future because I now know it can be fixed and I am more familiar with what to look for when errors occur. I don't need to panic about errors or get lost when trying to fix them. That influences my long term goals because as I want to become a web/mobile app developer, I feel more confident in my code, even when there are errors that pop up.

## The JavaScript Debugger

**How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?**
Built-in debuggers can be turned on and off, forcing errors to be reported to the user. With a debugger, you can also set breakpoints (places where code execution can be stopped), and examine variables while the code is executing.

**Define what a breakpoint is.**
A breakpoint is a point of code where the debugger will automatically pause the JavaScript execution. While the code is paused, we can examine current variables, execute commands in the console etc. In other words, we can debug it. We can always find a list of breakpoints in the right panel.

**What is the call stack?**
A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter, like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser, to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions, such as what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function.
