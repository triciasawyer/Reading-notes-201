## Video and Audio Content

**Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.**
The first influx of online videos and audio were made possible by proprietary plugin-based technologies like Flash and Silverlight. Both of these had security and accessibility issues, and are now obsolete. Today, video and audio on the web are much easier to apply, use, and access.

**Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the video element.**
The src attribute specifies the URL of the video file. The controls attribute is a boolean attribute. When present, it specifies that video controls should be displayed.

**Why is it important to have fallback content inside the video element?**
Until the video starts playing, the image is displayed in its place. If the browser doesn't support video playback, the fallback text is displayed. This is important in case the browser doesn't support it, so users see what is suppose to be there.

**Write a very short story where audio and video are characters.**
Video is walking down the street. No one can hear him, but they can see him. When audio goes on walks, everyone can hear him, but they can't see him. They knew they needed someone to help but didn't know who. One day, they ran into eachother, and noticed that they are exactly what each other need. Since meeting, they are inseperable and no longer struggling alone.

## A Complete Guide To Grid

**How does Grid layout differ from Flex?**
The difference between Grid Layout and Flex Layout is that flexb was designed for layout in one dimension - either a row or a column. Grid was designed for two-dimensional layout - rows, and columns at the same time.

**Grid container, grid item, and grid line are a few important terms to understand when using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences.**
A grid container defines a grid layout with rows and columns. It contains grid items that are placed in this grid. Grid lines are the lines that make us a grid. There are lines between columns, that are called column lines, and the lines between rows are called row lines.

## Responsive Images

**Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?**
It allows images to work well on devices with widely differing screen sizes, resolutions, and other such features.

**Define the following img attributes srcset and sizes. Write an example of how they are used.**
Srcset is used to specify the list of images to use in different browser situations. The browser will pick the most optimal image version, based on the screen size and resolution. The size attribute on an image specifies different image widths. These widths are tied to browser conditions which helps create responsive images.

**How is srcset more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?**
Srcset is more helpful than CSS and JavaScript because it allows the browser to pick the most optimal image version, based on the screen size and resolution, without having to use any javascript or mutliple CSS rules. Since using srcset allows the computer to choose, it will provide the best solution for the user, no matter what device they're viewing from.
