## JavaScript Canvas

**What does canvas allow a developer to acheive?**
Canvas is an HTML element which can be used to draw graphics via scripting (usually JavaScript). This can, for instance, be used to draw graphs, combine photos, or create simple animations

**How could Chart.js aid your previously created applications visually?**
Chart.js could aid my previous applications visually, by providing a visual for the data, such as our salmon cookies project that included a table with data.
