**What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?**
+Frame the work as a learning problem, not an execution problem.
+Acknowledge your own fallibility.
-Model curiosity and ask lots of questions.

**Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.**
I previously worked at an early childhood education center, and it wasn't easy by any means. There was lots of educational information about how to deal with the stress and such, but that only does such much alone. I think remembering that you aren't alone helps, but that only helps when others accept you as a team. No matter who you are, I think collaboration and togetherness is huge and helps with psychologoical safety, individually and as a team, especially in a high stress environment.

**What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?**
Teams actually want to show up to work and are proven to perform better, and have lower levels of interpersonal conflict.
